# Missing Components & Gaps
Date: 2026-01-09

## Resolved Items
- [x] `backend/api/settings_routes.py`: Created.
- [x] `backend/services/settings_service.py`: Created.
- [x] `backend/models/integrations.py`: Handled via in-memory mock in service.
- [x] `POST /api/v1/accounts/{id}/validate`: Added to `account_routes.py`.
- [x] `POST /api/v1/accounts/{id}/set-default`: Added to `account_routes.py`.

## Remaining Logic / Stubs
- [ ] `backend/core/action_executor.py`: Missing implementation for `RightSize`, `Consolidate`, `ScaleUp`, `ScaleDown` (marked as TODO).
- [ ] `backend/services/cluster_service.py`: `discover_clusters` returns hardcoded empty list.
- [ ] `backend/services/metrics_service.py`: `_calculate_savings` uses hardcoded 70% spot discount.


## Missing Logic / Stubs (Code exists but is incomplete)

However, there is one major component group that is part of your server-side ecosystem but sits just outside the backend/ folder in your file structure: the Kubernetes Agent.

Since you included docker/Dockerfile.backend (which is outside backend/), you should likely include the Agent as well, as it is the "hands" of your backend running on the clusters.

Here are the missing items:Suggested ID,File Path,Type,Function / Feature Description
