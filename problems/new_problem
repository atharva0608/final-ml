[Detailed description of what's wrong - be as specific as possible]

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step - where problem occurs]

**Expected Behavior**:
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior**:
[What actually happens - include error messages if any]

## 🚨 Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to determine severity level:

### CRITICAL ⚠️
- **Security vulnerabilities** (data exposure, authentication bypass, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Data loss or corruption** (user data deleted, database inconsistency)
- **Complete system failure** (app won't start, total crash, 500 errors)
- **Authentication broken** (can't log in, unauthorized access)
- **Database connection failures** (can't connect to DB)
- **Payment/billing issues** (incorrect charges, failed payments)

### HIGH 🔴
- **Major features completely broken** (can't connect AWS account, discovery fails)
- **Severe user experience degradation** (extremely slow, constant errors)
- **Data inconsistency** (wrong data displayed, calculations incorrect)
- **Performance severely degraded** (page takes >30 seconds to load)
- **Critical workflow blocked** (can't complete essential task)

### MEDIUM 🟡
- **Feature partially broken** (works sometimes, inconsistent behavior)
- **Workaround available** but inconvenient (can achieve goal via alternate method)
- **UI/UX issues** affecting usability (confusing interface, poor layout)
- **Minor data inconsistencies** (stale data, minor calculation errors)
- **Performance issues** (slow but usable, 5-10 second delays)

### LOW 🟢
- **Cosmetic issues** (styling problems, alignment issues, typos)
- **Minor inconveniences** (extra clicks needed, suboptimal flow)
- **Nice-to-have improvements** (feature requests, enhancements)
- **Documentation errors** (outdated docs, missing examples)
- **Edge case bugs** (rarely occurs, specific conditions)

## 💡 Example Problem Report (For Reference)

This is an example of a well-formatted problem report:

```markdown
## Problem: Dashboard shows $0 cost after connecting AWS account
**Reported**: 2025-12-25 10:30
**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: Dashboard / Metrics
**Reporter**: User

**Description**:
After connecting a new AWS account via CloudFormation method and successfully
completing resource discovery (status shows 'active'), the dashboard displays
"$0 Cost", "0% Usage", and shows no metrics or resource data. Expected to see
actual AWS usage and cost data immediately after discovery completes.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Log in to platform as client user
2. Navigate to "Connect AWS Account"
3. Select CloudFormation method
4. Deploy stack in AWS Console
5. Verify connection (status becomes 'connected')
6. Wait for discovery to complete (status becomes 'active')
7. Navigate to /client dashboard
8. Observe all metrics show zero/empty

**Expected Behavior**:
Dashboard should immediately display:
- Current month cost (e.g., "$45.67")
- CPU/memory usage percentages (e.g., "23% CPU")
- Instance count (e.g., "5 instances")
- Resource utilization charts with data
- Spot vs On-Demand breakdown

**Actual Behavior**:
Dashboard displays:
- Cost: "$0.00"
- Usage: "0% CPU, 0% Memory"
- Instances: "No instances found"
- All charts are empty
- No resource data visible

Data DOES appear after midnight when the scheduled cron job runs, indicating
the health check system is not being triggered immediately after discovery.

**Additional Context**:
- Discovery worker completes successfully (logs show "Discovery completed")
- Instances ARE created in database (verified via SQL query)
- account.status transitions correctly: pending → connected → active
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Issue occurs consistently on fresh account connections
- Workaround: Wait until midnight OR manually trigger health checks
- Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 121 (both affected)
- Environment: Production

**Suspected Root Cause**:
Health checks may only run on scheduled cron (midnight), not immediately
after discovery completion. Need to trigger component_health_checks()
right after discovery_worker finishes.
```

## ✅ Tips for Effective Problem Reports

1. **Be Specific**:
   - ✅ "DELETE /client/accounts/123 returns HTTP 204 causing JSON parse error"
   - ❌ "Delete doesn't work"

2. **Include Context**:
   - Browser and version (Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17)
   - User role (Admin, Client, Lab user)
   - Account state (fresh connection, existing account, specific AWS region)
   - Timestamp when issue occurred

3. **One Problem Per Report**:
   - Don't combine "Dashboard is slow AND delete button is broken"
   - Submit separate reports for separate issues

4. **Check Existing Issues First**:
   - Look in `/problems/problems_log.md` to see if already reported
   - Check `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md` to see if already fixed

5. **Be Honest About Severity**:
   - Don't mark everything as CRITICAL
   - Use the severity guidelines above
   - LLM will prioritize accordingly

6. **Plain Text is Fine**:
   - Don't worry about perfect formatting
   - Just describe the problem clearly
   - Template is optional, not required

## 🔍 Recently Fixed Problems (Reference)

These problems were reported here and have been fixed:

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-003: DELETE endpoint HTTP 204 error
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: DELETE /client/accounts/{id} returned HTTP 204 (No Content) without
response body, causing frontend JSON parsing errors. Fixed by explicitly setting
status_code=200 with success message body.
**File**: backend/api/client_routes.py:84-143

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-002: Dashboard zero data after fresh connection
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: Dashboard showed $0 and no metrics immediately after account connection.
Fixed by triggering component_health_checks() immediately after discovery_worker
completion instead of waiting for midnight cron.
**File**: backend/workers/discovery_worker.py:334-340

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-001: AWS account takeover vulnerability
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: CloudFormation onboarding flow lacked global account_id uniqueness check,
allowing one AWS account to be connected to multiple users. Fixed by adding uniqueness
validation before account creation.
**File**: backend/api/onboarding_routes.py:495

## Your Problem(s) - Add Below This Line:

Based on the review of your codebase and the workflow you described, here is the detailed analysis of the problems.

### 1. The "Orphan User" Problem (Why Dashboard Fails for Admin-Created Users)

**The Problem:** When you create a client from the Admin Dashboard, the system creates a **User** record but fails to create a corresponding **Account** record.
**The Reason:**

* The logic in the Admin creation function (`admin.py`) only inserts data into the `users` table.
* The Client Dashboard (`client_routes.py`) is programmed to immediately fetch the `Account` associated with the logged-in user.
* Since the Admin-created user has no entry in the `accounts` table, the API returns a 404 or null.
* The Frontend (`DashboardLayout.jsx`) tries to read properties (like `account_id` or `status`) from this null response, causing the "Unable to load" error.

### 2. The "Amnesiac" Cloud Connect Page (Why it asks for credentials again)

**The Problem:** After successfully connecting, refreshing the page or navigating back to "Cloud Connect" resets the form to empty, asking for keys again.
**The Reason:**

* The `ClientSetup.jsx` component (Frontend) does not perform a **Status Check** when it loads.
* It is currently hardcoded to default to the "Input Form" view.
* It ignores the fact that the backend already has the credentials saved. It should be calling a "Get Current Account" API immediately upon loading. If an account exists, it should render a "Connected Status" card instead of the "Input Form".

### 3. Missing Feedback & Persistence (How to know if connected)

**The Problem:** There is no visual confirmation of a persistent connection.
**The Reason:**

* **No "Read" Mode:** The Cloud Connect component only has a "Write" mode (Post credentials). It lacks a "Read" mode (Display current connection).
* **No State polling:** The frontend does not poll the backend to check if the `status` column in the database has changed from `pending` to `active` or `scanning`.
* **UX Flaw:** Because of this, the user has no way of knowing if the previous attempt actually worked, leading to confusion and the urge to re-enter credentials.

### 4. The "Hotel California" Issue (No Disconnect Option)

**The Problem:** You can check in (connect), but you can never leave (disconnect).
**The Reason:**

* **Missing API Logic:** While you might have a route to *add* an account, there is no exposed endpoint in the frontend to *delete* or *unlink* the `Account` row or reset its columns.
* **UI Gap:** The Frontend lacks a "Disconnect" or "Remove Account" button.
* **Security Risk:** Without a disconnect feature, users cannot easily rotate credentials or switch AWS accounts if they make a mistake, forcing them to mess with the database directly.

### 5. UX Verdict: Is this Good?

**Verdict:** **No, this is poor User Experience.**

* **Redundancy:** Asking for secret keys (which are sensitive) on every refresh makes the user feel the system is insecure or didn't save their data.
* **Blindness:** Users are operating blindly without status indicators (Green/Red dots, "Connected" labels).
* **Frustration:** The "Unable to load" dashboard for Admin-created users makes the system feel broken from the very first login.

### Summary of Required Architectural Fixes

1. **Admin Logic:** Ensure `admin.py` creates a "Placeholder Account" row whenever it creates a generic "Client" user.
2. **Frontend Initialization:** The `ClientSetup` component must fetch `/api/client/accounts` immediately on mount. If data exists, hide the form and show the details.
3. **State Management:** The Dashboard needs to handle the `no_account` state gracefully (e.g., by redirecting to the setup page instead of crashing).
4. **Disconnect Feature:** Implement a specific "Disconnect" button that clears the credentials from the database and resets the UI state.
