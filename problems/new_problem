**Severity**: HIGH

## Tips for Effective Problem Reports

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact error messages, URLs, and steps
2. **Include Context**: Browser, OS, user role, account state
3. **One Problem Per Report**: Don't combine multiple issues
4. **Check Existing**: Look in problems_log.md first to avoid duplicates
5. **Severity**: Be honest about severity (don't inflate)
