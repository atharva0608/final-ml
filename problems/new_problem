# Active Problems Inbox - New Problem Reporting

## 📋 Instructions for Reporting Problems

This file is your **direct communication channel** with the LLM for reporting new problems, issues, bugs, or requests.

### How It Works

When you discover an issue or have a request:

1. **Scroll to the bottom** of this file to the section marked "PASTE YOUR PROBLEMS HERE ↓"
2. **Paste your problem description** (can be plain text, structured, or use the template below)
3. **Save this file**
4. **Start a new LLM session** or continue an existing one

The LLM will automatically:
1. ✅ Read this file at session start
2. ✅ Assign a Problem ID (format: `P-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`)
3. ✅ Add it to `/problems/problems_log.md` as "Active"
4. ✅ Investigate and fix the problem
5. ✅ Remove the fixed portion from this file
6. ✅ Document the fix in `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md`
7. ✅ Update all relevant documentation

## 📝 Problem Reporting Template (Optional - Use if Helpful)

You can use this structured template or just paste plain text below. Both work!

```markdown
## Problem: [Short descriptive title]
**Reported**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Severity**: [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
**Component**: [Which part of the system - e.g., Dashboard, API, Auth, etc.]
**Reporter**: [Your name or "User"]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of what's wrong - be as specific as possible]

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step - where problem occurs]

**Expected Behavior**:
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior**:
[What actually happens - include error messages if any]

**Additional Context**:
- Error messages (copy/paste exact text)
- Screenshots (describe or reference)
- Logs or stack traces
- Browser/environment details
- Any other relevant information

---
```

## 🚨 Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to determine severity level:

### CRITICAL ⚠️
- **Security vulnerabilities** (data exposure, authentication bypass, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Data loss or corruption** (user data deleted, database inconsistency)
- **Complete system failure** (app won't start, total crash, 500 errors)
- **Authentication broken** (can't log in, unauthorized access)
- **Database connection failures** (can't connect to DB)
- **Payment/billing issues** (incorrect charges, failed payments)

### HIGH 🔴
- **Major features completely broken** (can't connect AWS account, discovery fails)
- **Severe user experience degradation** (extremely slow, constant errors)
- **Data inconsistency** (wrong data displayed, calculations incorrect)
- **Performance severely degraded** (page takes >30 seconds to load)
- **Critical workflow blocked** (can't complete essential task)

### MEDIUM 🟡
- **Feature partially broken** (works sometimes, inconsistent behavior)
- **Workaround available** but inconvenient (can achieve goal via alternate method)
- **UI/UX issues** affecting usability (confusing interface, poor layout)
- **Minor data inconsistencies** (stale data, minor calculation errors)
- **Performance issues** (slow but usable, 5-10 second delays)

### LOW 🟢
- **Cosmetic issues** (styling problems, alignment issues, typos)
- **Minor inconveniences** (extra clicks needed, suboptimal flow)
- **Nice-to-have improvements** (feature requests, enhancements)
- **Documentation errors** (outdated docs, missing examples)
- **Edge case bugs** (rarely occurs, specific conditions)

## 💡 Example Problem Report (For Reference)

This is an example of a well-formatted problem report:

```markdown
## Problem: Dashboard shows $0 cost after connecting AWS account
**Reported**: 2025-12-25 10:30
**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: Dashboard / Metrics
**Reporter**: User

**Description**:
After connecting a new AWS account via CloudFormation method and successfully
completing resource discovery (status shows 'active'), the dashboard displays
"$0 Cost", "0% Usage", and shows no metrics or resource data. Expected to see
actual AWS usage and cost data immediately after discovery completes.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Log in to platform as client user
2. Navigate to "Connect AWS Account"
3. Select CloudFormation method
4. Deploy stack in AWS Console
5. Verify connection (status becomes 'connected')
6. Wait for discovery to complete (status becomes 'active')
7. Navigate to /client dashboard
8. Observe all metrics show zero/empty

**Expected Behavior**:
Dashboard should immediately display:
- Current month cost (e.g., "$45.67")
- CPU/memory usage percentages (e.g., "23% CPU")
- Instance count (e.g., "5 instances")
- Resource utilization charts with data
- Spot vs On-Demand breakdown

**Actual Behavior**:
Dashboard displays:
- Cost: "$0.00"
- Usage: "0% CPU, 0% Memory"
- Instances: "No instances found"
- All charts are empty
- No resource data visible

Data DOES appear after midnight when the scheduled cron job runs, indicating
the health check system is not being triggered immediately after discovery.

**Additional Context**:
- Discovery worker completes successfully (logs show "Discovery completed")
- Instances ARE created in database (verified via SQL query)
- account.status transitions correctly: pending → connected → active
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Issue occurs consistently on fresh account connections
- Workaround: Wait until midnight OR manually trigger health checks
- Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 121 (both affected)
- Environment: Production

**Suspected Root Cause**:
Health checks may only run on scheduled cron (midnight), not immediately
after discovery completion. Need to trigger component_health_checks()
right after discovery_worker finishes.
```

## ✅ Tips for Effective Problem Reports

1. **Be Specific**:
   - ✅ "DELETE /client/accounts/123 returns HTTP 204 causing JSON parse error"
   - ❌ "Delete doesn't work"

2. **Include Context**:
   - Browser and version (Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17)
   - User role (Admin, Client, Lab user)
   - Account state (fresh connection, existing account, specific AWS region)
   - Timestamp when issue occurred

3. **One Problem Per Report**:
   - Don't combine "Dashboard is slow AND delete button is broken"
   - Submit separate reports for separate issues

4. **Check Existing Issues First**:
   - Look in `/problems/problems_log.md` to see if already reported
   - Check `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md` to see if already fixed

5. **Be Honest About Severity**:
   - Don't mark everything as CRITICAL
   - Use the severity guidelines above
   - LLM will prioritize accordingly

6. **Plain Text is Fine**:
   - Don't worry about perfect formatting
   - Just describe the problem clearly
   - Template is optional, not required

## 🔍 Recently Fixed Problems (Reference)

These problems were reported here and have been fixed:

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-003: DELETE endpoint HTTP 204 error
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: DELETE /client/accounts/{id} returned HTTP 204 (No Content) without
response body, causing frontend JSON parsing errors. Fixed by explicitly setting
status_code=200 with success message body.
**File**: backend/api/client_routes.py:84-143

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-002: Dashboard zero data after fresh connection
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: Dashboard showed $0 and no metrics immediately after account connection.
Fixed by triggering component_health_checks() immediately after discovery_worker
completion instead of waiting for midnight cron.
**File**: backend/workers/discovery_worker.py:334-340

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-001: AWS account takeover vulnerability
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: CloudFormation onboarding flow lacked global account_id uniqueness check,
allowing one AWS account to be connected to multiple users. Fixed by adding uniqueness
validation before account creation.
**File**: backend/api/onboarding_routes.py:495

# ⬇️ PASTE YOUR PROBLEMS HERE ⬇️

## Instructions:
- Paste your problem description below this line
- Can be plain text, bullet points, or use the template above
- Multiple problems? Add them one after another, separated by "---"
- Don't worry about formatting - just describe the issue clearly
- Save this file when done

## Your Problem(s) - Add Below This Line:

[Your problem description goes here - plain text is fine!]

Example plain text format (delete this before adding your problem):
"The dashboard is loading very slowly - takes about 45 seconds to show data after
clicking on the Dashboard link. This happens every time I log in. I'm using Chrome
on Mac. The API seems slow because I can see the loading spinner for a long time.
Not sure if this is normal or a bug but it's really annoying."

Or use structured format:
Problem: Dashboard extremely slow to load
When: Every time I navigate to /client/dashboard
Severity: Medium (it works, just slow)
Details: Takes 45+ seconds to display data, loading spinner shows entire time
Browser: Chrome 120 on macOS
