**Severity**: [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
**Component**: [Which part of the system - e.g., Dashboard, API, Auth, etc.]
**Reporter**: [Your name or "User"]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of what's wrong - be as specific as possible]

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step - where problem occurs]

**Expected Behavior**:
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior**:
[What actually happens - include error messages if any]

**Additional Context**:
- Error messages (copy/paste exact text)
- Screenshots (describe or reference)
- Logs or stack traces
- Browser/environment details
- Any other relevant information

## 🚨 Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to determine severity level:

### CRITICAL ⚠️
- **Security vulnerabilities** (data exposure, authentication bypass, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Data loss or corruption** (user data deleted, database inconsistency)
- **Complete system failure** (app won't start, total crash, 500 errors)
- **Authentication broken** (can't log in, unauthorized access)
- **Database connection failures** (can't connect to DB)
- **Payment/billing issues** (incorrect charges, failed payments)

### HIGH 🔴
- **Major features completely broken** (can't connect AWS account, discovery fails)
- **Severe user experience degradation** (extremely slow, constant errors)
- **Data inconsistency** (wrong data displayed, calculations incorrect)
- **Performance severely degraded** (page takes >30 seconds to load)
- **Critical workflow blocked** (can't complete essential task)

### MEDIUM 🟡
- **Feature partially broken** (works sometimes, inconsistent behavior)
- **Workaround available** but inconvenient (can achieve goal via alternate method)
- **UI/UX issues** affecting usability (confusing interface, poor layout)
- **Minor data inconsistencies** (stale data, minor calculation errors)
- **Performance issues** (slow but usable, 5-10 second delays)

### LOW 🟢
- **Cosmetic issues** (styling problems, alignment issues, typos)
- **Minor inconveniences** (extra clicks needed, suboptimal flow)
- **Nice-to-have improvements** (feature requests, enhancements)
- **Documentation errors** (outdated docs, missing examples)
- **Edge case bugs** (rarely occurs, specific conditions)

## 💡 Example Problem Report (For Reference)

This is an example of a well-formatted problem report:

```markdown
## Problem: Dashboard shows $0 cost after connecting AWS account
**Reported**: 2025-12-25 10:30
**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: Dashboard / Metrics
**Reporter**: User

**Description**:
After connecting a new AWS account via CloudFormation method and successfully
completing resource discovery (status shows 'active'), the dashboard displays
"$0 Cost", "0% Usage", and shows no metrics or resource data. Expected to see
actual AWS usage and cost data immediately after discovery completes.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Log in to platform as client user
2. Navigate to "Connect AWS Account"
3. Select CloudFormation method
4. Deploy stack in AWS Console
5. Verify connection (status becomes 'connected')
6. Wait for discovery to complete (status becomes 'active')
7. Navigate to /client dashboard
8. Observe all metrics show zero/empty

**Expected Behavior**:
Dashboard should immediately display:
- Current month cost (e.g., "$45.67")
- CPU/memory usage percentages (e.g., "23% CPU")
- Instance count (e.g., "5 instances")
- Resource utilization charts with data
- Spot vs On-Demand breakdown

**Actual Behavior**:
Dashboard displays:
- Cost: "$0.00"
- Usage: "0% CPU, 0% Memory"
- Instances: "No instances found"
- All charts are empty
- No resource data visible

Data DOES appear after midnight when the scheduled cron job runs, indicating
the health check system is not being triggered immediately after discovery.

**Additional Context**:
- Discovery worker completes successfully (logs show "Discovery completed")
- Instances ARE created in database (verified via SQL query)
- account.status transitions correctly: pending → connected → active
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Issue occurs consistently on fresh account connections
- Workaround: Wait until midnight OR manually trigger health checks
- Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 121 (both affected)
- Environment: Production

**Suspected Root Cause**:
Health checks may only run on scheduled cron (midnight), not immediately
after discovery completion. Need to trigger component_health_checks()
right after discovery_worker finishes.
```

## ✅ Tips for Effective Problem Reports

1. **Be Specific**:
   - ✅ "DELETE /client/accounts/123 returns HTTP 204 causing JSON parse error"
   - ❌ "Delete doesn't work"

2. **Include Context**:
   - Browser and version (Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17)
   - User role (Admin, Client, Lab user)
   - Account state (fresh connection, existing account, specific AWS region)
   - Timestamp when issue occurred

3. **One Problem Per Report**:
   - Don't combine "Dashboard is slow AND delete button is broken"
   - Submit separate reports for separate issues

4. **Check Existing Issues First**:
   - Look in `/problems/problems_log.md` to see if already reported
   - Check `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md` to see if already fixed

5. **Be Honest About Severity**:
   - Don't mark everything as CRITICAL
   - Use the severity guidelines above
   - LLM will prioritize accordingly

6. **Plain Text is Fine**:
   - Don't worry about perfect formatting
   - Just describe the problem clearly
   - Template is optional, not required

## 🔍 Recently Fixed Problems (Reference)

These problems were reported here and have been fixed:

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-003: DELETE endpoint HTTP 204 error
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: DELETE /client/accounts/{id} returned HTTP 204 (No Content) without
response body, causing frontend JSON parsing errors. Fixed by explicitly setting
status_code=200 with success message body.
**File**: backend/api/client_routes.py:84-143

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-002: Dashboard zero data after fresh connection
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: Dashboard showed $0 and no metrics immediately after account connection.
Fixed by triggering component_health_checks() immediately after discovery_worker
completion instead of waiting for midnight cron.
**File**: backend/workers/discovery_worker.py:334-340

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-001: AWS account takeover vulnerability
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: CloudFormation onboarding flow lacked global account_id uniqueness check,
allowing one AWS account to be connected to multiple users. Fixed by adding uniqueness
validation before account creation.
**File**: backend/api/onboarding_routes.py:495

**Note**: No new problems currently pending. Add new problems below this line.
1. The "Zombie Database" (Schema Drift)
The Reason: Your code has been updated to include new columns (like connection_method, aws_access_key_id), but your local Docker Database Volume was created weeks ago. It still has the old table structure.

The Crash: When admin.py tries to insert the "Placeholder Account", the database rejects it with Column 'connection_method' not found.

The Silent Failure: If your code has a broad try/except block, it catches this error, ignores the account creation, but still returns "Success" for the User creation.

Result: The User is created (Orphan), but the Account is missing. When you log in, the Dashboard crashes (Blank Page) because it expects an Account.

2. The "Partial Commit" Bug (Why Admin Users are Blank)
The Reason: In backend/api/admin.py, it is highly likely that the database commit is split.

Scenario:

db.add(new_user) -> db.commit() (User saved successfully).

db.add(placeholder_account) -> db.commit() (FAILS due to Schema Drift above).

Outcome: You have a User record, but 0 Account records. The Dashboard API (GET /dashboard) looks for an account, finds nothing, returns null, and the Frontend crashes trying to read null.status.

✅ The Fix: After resetting the database (Step 1), this will resolve itself. However, to prevent this forever, verify that your admin.py creates both objects before committing.

3. The "Status Filter" Mismatch (Why Connection Doesn't Persist)
The Reason: You connect successfully, but the form reappears.

Backend: When you connect via credentials, the status is set to connected.

Frontend Check: The ClientSetup.jsx calls GET /client/accounts.

The Bug: If your GET /client/accounts API in backend/api/client_routes.py has a filter like .filter(Account.status == 'active'), it will hide your new account (which is 'connected') from the list.

Result: The list returns [] (empty), so the Frontend thinks "No accounts exist" and shows the connection form again.

✅ The Fix: Open backend/api/client_routes.py and ensure the get_connected_accounts function does NOT strictly filter by 'active'. It should return everything.

Python

# backend/api/client_routes.py

@router.get("/accounts", response_model=List[AccountSummary])
def get_connected_accounts(...):
    # BAD: return db.query(Account).filter(Account.status == 'active').all()
    
    # GOOD: Return all accounts regardless of status
    return db.query(Account).filter(Account.user_id == current_user.id).all()
