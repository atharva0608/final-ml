**Reporter**: [Your name or "User"]

**Description**:
[Detailed description of what's wrong - be as specific as possible]

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step - where problem occurs]

**Expected Behavior**:
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior**:
[What actually happens - include error messages if any]

**Additional Context**:
- Error messages (copy/paste exact text)
- Screenshots (describe or reference)
- Logs or stack traces
- Browser/environment details
- Any other relevant information

---
```

## 🚨 Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to determine severity level:

### CRITICAL ⚠️
- **Security vulnerabilities** (data exposure, authentication bypass, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Data loss or corruption** (user data deleted, database inconsistency)
- **Complete system failure** (app won't start, total crash, 500 errors)
- **Authentication broken** (can't log in, unauthorized access)
- **Database connection failures** (can't connect to DB)
- **Payment/billing issues** (incorrect charges, failed payments)

### HIGH 🔴
- **Major features completely broken** (can't connect AWS account, discovery fails)
- **Severe user experience degradation** (extremely slow, constant errors)
- **Data inconsistency** (wrong data displayed, calculations incorrect)
- **Performance severely degraded** (page takes >30 seconds to load)
- **Critical workflow blocked** (can't complete essential task)

### MEDIUM 🟡
- **Feature partially broken** (works sometimes, inconsistent behavior)
- **Workaround available** but inconvenient (can achieve goal via alternate method)
- **UI/UX issues** affecting usability (confusing interface, poor layout)
- **Minor data inconsistencies** (stale data, minor calculation errors)
- **Performance issues** (slow but usable, 5-10 second delays)

### LOW 🟢
- **Cosmetic issues** (styling problems, alignment issues, typos)
- **Minor inconveniences** (extra clicks needed, suboptimal flow)
- **Nice-to-have improvements** (feature requests, enhancements)
- **Documentation errors** (outdated docs, missing examples)
- **Edge case bugs** (rarely occurs, specific conditions)

## 💡 Example Problem Report (For Reference)

This is an example of a well-formatted problem report:

```markdown
## Problem: Dashboard shows $0 cost after connecting AWS account
**Reported**: 2025-12-25 10:30
**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: Dashboard / Metrics
**Reporter**: User

**Description**:
After connecting a new AWS account via CloudFormation method and successfully
completing resource discovery (status shows 'active'), the dashboard displays
"$0 Cost", "0% Usage", and shows no metrics or resource data. Expected to see
actual AWS usage and cost data immediately after discovery completes.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Log in to platform as client user
2. Navigate to "Connect AWS Account"
3. Select CloudFormation method
4. Deploy stack in AWS Console
5. Verify connection (status becomes 'connected')
6. Wait for discovery to complete (status becomes 'active')
7. Navigate to /client dashboard
8. Observe all metrics show zero/empty

**Expected Behavior**:
Dashboard should immediately display:
- Current month cost (e.g., "$45.67")
- CPU/memory usage percentages (e.g., "23% CPU")
- Instance count (e.g., "5 instances")
- Resource utilization charts with data
- Spot vs On-Demand breakdown

**Actual Behavior**:
Dashboard displays:
- Cost: "$0.00"
- Usage: "0% CPU, 0% Memory"
- Instances: "No instances found"
- All charts are empty
- No resource data visible

Data DOES appear after midnight when the scheduled cron job runs, indicating
the health check system is not being triggered immediately after discovery.

**Additional Context**:
- Discovery worker completes successfully (logs show "Discovery completed")
- Instances ARE created in database (verified via SQL query)
- account.status transitions correctly: pending → connected → active
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Issue occurs consistently on fresh account connections
- Workaround: Wait until midnight OR manually trigger health checks
- Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 121 (both affected)
- Environment: Production

**Suspected Root Cause**:
Health checks may only run on scheduled cron (midnight), not immediately
after discovery completion. Need to trigger component_health_checks()
right after discovery_worker finishes.
```

## ✅ Tips for Effective Problem Reports

1. **Be Specific**:
   - ✅ "DELETE /client/accounts/123 returns HTTP 204 causing JSON parse error"
   - ❌ "Delete doesn't work"

2. **Include Context**:
   - Browser and version (Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17)
   - User role (Admin, Client, Lab user)
   - Account state (fresh connection, existing account, specific AWS region)
   - Timestamp when issue occurred

3. **One Problem Per Report**:
   - Don't combine "Dashboard is slow AND delete button is broken"
   - Submit separate reports for separate issues

4. **Check Existing Issues First**:
   - Look in `/problems/problems_log.md` to see if already reported
   - Check `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md` to see if already fixed

5. **Be Honest About Severity**:
   - Don't mark everything as CRITICAL
   - Use the severity guidelines above
   - LLM will prioritize accordingly

6. **Plain Text is Fine**:
   - Don't worry about perfect formatting
   - Just describe the problem clearly
   - Template is optional, not required

## 🔍 Recently Fixed Problems (Reference)

These problems were reported here and have been fixed:

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-003: DELETE endpoint HTTP 204 error
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: DELETE /client/accounts/{id} returned HTTP 204 (No Content) without
response body, causing frontend JSON parsing errors. Fixed by explicitly setting
status_code=200 with success message body.
**File**: backend/api/client_routes.py:84-143

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-002: Dashboard zero data after fresh connection
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: Dashboard showed $0 and no metrics immediately after account connection.
Fixed by triggering component_health_checks() immediately after discovery_worker
completion instead of waiting for midnight cron.
**File**: backend/workers/discovery_worker.py:334-340

### ✅ P-2025-12-25-001: AWS account takeover vulnerability
**Fixed**: 2025-12-25
**Summary**: CloudFormation onboarding flow lacked global account_id uniqueness check,
allowing one AWS account to be connected to multiple users. Fixed by adding uniqueness
validation before account creation.
**File**: backend/api/onboarding_routes.py:495

## INVESTIGATION COMPLETE (2025-12-26) - Session 2

**Status**: 3 problems investigated, 1 FIXED, 2 NOT CODE BUGS

### Investigation Results:

**P-2025-12-26-001: "Zombie Database" (Schema Drift)** ⚠️ ENVIRONMENT ISSUE
- **Investigation**: Reviewed database models.py - schema definition is **CORRECT**
- **Columns exist**: connection_method (line 81), aws_access_key_id (line 89), aws_secret_access_key (line 90)
- **Root cause**: User's local Docker database volume has outdated schema
- **Resolution**: User needs to drop/recreate database OR run migrations
- **Code change**: NONE - this is an environment/deployment issue
- **Reference**: `/problems/problems_log.md#P-2025-12-26-001`

**P-2025-12-26-002: "Partial Commit Bug"** ❌ NOT A BUG
- **Investigation**: Reviewed admin.py:722-745
- **Finding**: Code has SINGLE commit at line 745 for both User and Account
- **Structure**: `db.add(user)` → `db.flush()` → `db.add(account)` → `db.commit()`
- **This is CORRECT**: flush() generates ID without committing, final commit saves both atomically
- **If failures occur**: They're due to P-2025-12-26-001 (schema drift) causing entire transaction to fail
- **Code change**: NONE - implementation is correct
- **Reference**: `/problems/problems_log.md#P-2025-12-26-002`

**P-2025-12-26-003: "Status Filter Mismatch"** ✅ FIXED
- **Investigation**: Reviewed client_routes.py:52-55
- **Bug confirmed**: GET /client/accounts filtered by `status.in_(["connected", "active", "warning"])`
- **Problem**: Admin creates placeholder accounts with status="pending" (admin.py:737)
- **Impact**: Pending accounts hidden from user, frontend shows onboarding form
- **Fix applied**: Removed status filter - now returns ALL accounts for user
- **Code changed**: `backend/api/client_routes.py:46-56`
- **Reference**: `/progress/fixed_issues_log.md#P-2025-12-26-003`

### Summary:
- **1 REAL BUG** - Status filter fixed
- **2 NOT BUGS** - Schema drift (environment) and partial commit (code is correct)

---

**Note**: No new problems currently pending. Add new problems below this line.

Here is the comprehensive fix for the **"Login Loop"**, **"Unable to Load"**, and the **`TypeError: de.get`** crash.

These issues are caused by **File Conflicts** (multiple API files confusing the bundler) and **Strict Filtering** (Backend hiding the new account).

---

### 🚨 Problem Analysis

1. **`TypeError: de.get is not a function`**: You have **3 different API files** (`api.js`, `api.jsx`, `apiClient.jsx`). The build system is likely importing the **Empty** `api.jsx` instead of the real one, causing the app to crash when it tries to call `.get()`.
2. **The "Setup Loop"**: When you connect an account, it gets status **"connected"**. However, your Dashboard API only returns accounts with status **"active"**.
* *Result:* You connect -> Success -> Redirect to Dashboard -> Dashboard asks "Do you have an Active account?" -> API says "No" -> Dashboard kicks you back to Setup.



---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Fix the API Client (The Crash)

You must delete the conflicting files and keep one single source of truth.

**1. DELETE these files (if they exist):**

* `frontend/src/services/api.jsx` (This is likely the empty culprit)
* `frontend/src/services/apiClient.jsx`

**2. UPDATE `frontend/src/services/api.js` with this robust code:**

```javascript
// frontend/src/services/api.js
import axios from 'axios';

// 1. Determine Base URL (Production vs Local)
const getBaseUrl = () => {
  if (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL) {
    return import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
  }
  return window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:8000/api' 
    : '/api';
};

// 2. Create Axios Instance
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: getBaseUrl(),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// 3. Request Interceptor (Attach Token)
api.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);

// 4. Response Interceptor (Handle 401 Logout)
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response && error.response.status === 401) {
      console.warn('Unauthorized - Redirecting to Login');
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
      // Optional: window.location.href = '/login'; 
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export default api;

```

### 🛠️ Step 2: Fix the Backend Visibility (The Loop)

We need the Dashboard to see your account *immediately* after connection, even if it's not fully "active" yet.

**Target File:** `backend/api/client_routes.py`

**Update the `get_connected_accounts` function:**

```python
# backend/api/client_routes.py

@router.get("/accounts", response_model=List[AccountSummary])
async def get_connected_accounts(
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """List all accounts connected by this user (connected, scanning, active, etc)"""
    
    # OLD CODE (Likely caused the bug):
    # return db.query(Account).filter(Account.status == 'active', ...).all()

    # NEW CORRECT CODE:
    accounts = db.query(Account).filter(
        Account.user_id == current_user.id
        # We REMOVED the status filter so "connected" and "pending" accounts show up
    ).all()
    
    # ... (rest of your logic to map to AccountSummary) ...
    return results

```

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Fix the Frontend Gateway (The Logic)

Your `AuthGateway.jsx` was empty in the upload. This component is critical for deciding where the user goes.

**Update `frontend/src/components/AuthGateway.jsx`:**

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import api from '../services/api'; // Now imports strictly from api.js

export default function AuthGateway({ children }) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const location = useLocation();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkStatus = async () => {
      try {
        const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
        if (!token) {
            // No token, let the router handle redirect to login
            setLoading(false);
            return;
        }

        // Fetch Accounts
        const res = await api.get('/client/accounts');
        const accounts = res.data || [];
        
        const hasAccount = accounts.length > 0;
        const isOnSetup = location.pathname === '/onboarding/setup';

        if (hasAccount && isOnSetup) {
          // If we have an account but are on setup -> Go Dashboard
          console.log("Account found, redirecting to Dashboard");
          navigate('/dashboard');
        } else if (!hasAccount && !isOnSetup) {
          // If no account and NOT on setup -> Go Setup
          console.log("No account found, forcing Setup");
          navigate('/onboarding/setup');
        }

      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Auth Gateway Error:", err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    checkStatus();
  }, [navigate, location]);

  if (loading) return <div className="h-screen flex items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>;
  
  return children;
}

```

### 🚀 How to Apply & Verify

1. **Delete** the confusing `api.jsx` / `apiClient.jsx` files.
2. **Paste** the new `api.js` code.
3. **Paste** the new `client_routes.py` code (backend).
4. **Restart** the Backend (`docker-compose restart backend`).
5. **Refresh Frontend**.

**Expected Behavior:**

1. You login.
2. Gateway checks `/client/accounts`.
3. If you previously connected, backend now returns `[ { status: 'connected' } ]`.
4. Frontend sees `length > 0` -> Redirects to Dashboard.
5. Dashboard loads (No `de.get` error because `api.js` is fixed).
